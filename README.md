The dataset provided in Excel has been delimited and it has been loaded as dataframe in jupyter notebook by Neglecting the first 50 rows.
The column' VO2max' has been converted as integer and encoded into groups(named by colours) and created a dataframe by using the new VO2max column by counting the occurance of each colour and plotted the graphs.
The line graph has been plotted according to the classification done based on VO2max coloumn.
The heart rate signal has been generated according to the cumulative time and the artifact corrected heart rate coloumn.
Random noise signal has been created and it has been added with the heart rate signal.
The signal to noise ratio has been found.
